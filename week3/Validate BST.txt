Validate BST

Write a function that takes in the root of a potentially invalid Binary Search Tree (BST)
and returns a boolean representing whether the BST is valid.

Each BST node has an integer value, a
left child node, and a right child node. A node is
said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST
property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every
node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values
of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid
BST nodes themselves or undefined / null.

A BST is valid if and only if all of its nodes are valid
BST nodes.

Sample Input

tree =   10
       /     \
      5      15
    /   \   /   \
   2     5 13   22
 /           \
1            14

Sample Output

true

Node = {
	value: 10,
	left: Node,
	right: Node
};

  Function Declaration

const validateBst = (root) => {

};

Target Complexity

O(n) time | O(d) space - where n is the number of nodes in the BST and d is the depth (height) of the BST
