Insertion Sort

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted
version of that array. Use the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort the array.

Sample Input
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]

Sample Output
[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]

Function Declaration

const insertionSort = (array) => {

};

Target Complexity

Best: O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
Average: O(n^2) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
Worst: O(n^2) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
